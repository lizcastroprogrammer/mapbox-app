# Real-Time Bus Tracking App
## Description
This app allows you to see the various bus stops between two pre-set coordinates at the click of a button. Clicking on the button will cycle through all of the bus stops and show them on the screen with a marker on a map using mapbox.
## How to Run
Load the app into your browser and click on the button to show each individual bus stop location.
## Future Updates
I plan to add an option to instead get directions between the two coordinates.
